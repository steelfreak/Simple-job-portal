# Job Portal Single Page Application

## Overview

This is a simple, lightweight job portal Single Page Application (SPA) built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app allows users to browse job listings, view details in collapsible sections, search/filter jobs by keywords, and simulate the application process.

The project uses modern front-end techniques without any backend, keeping all interactions and data in the browser for demonstration and prototyping purposes.

***

## Features

- Responsive, clean UI with intuitive interaction
- Job listings displayed with first line summary (title and company)
- Clicking a job expands/collapses detailed info including location, salary, type, description, and requirements
- Search box to filter jobs by title, company, or location dynamically
- "Apply" button on each job which toggles to "Applied" state to simulate applying
- Search and job data are fully dynamic and client-side
- Jobs data stored externally in a separate JavaScript file for modularity
- All application logic is in an external JavaScript file separate from markup and styles
- Fully accessible and keyboard navigable

***

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone or download the project files.
2. Ensure the following files exist in the same directory:
   - `index.html` — the main HTML file
   - `styles.css` — CSS styles
   - `jobs.js` — JavaScript file containing job data
   - `app.js` — JavaScript for rendering and app logic
3. Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).
4. You can start browsing jobs, search by keywords, and simulate applying to jobs right away, no server or setup required.

## File Structure

```
/job-portal-spa
│
├── index.html       # Main HTML page with search input and job container
├── styles.css       # CSS styling for layout, buttons, and interaction
├── jobs.js          # JavaScript file exporting jobs data array
└── app.js           # JavaScript for rendering jobs, search filtering, and applying
```

***

## Usage

- **Searching:** Type keywords in the search box to filter job listings by title, company, or location in real time.
- **Expanding Job Details:** Click on any job header to expand or collapse detailed job info.
- **Applying:** Click the "Apply" button in the job details to simulate applying for a job; the button disables afterward to indicate application status.

***

## Technologies Used

- HTML5 for semantic markup
- CSS3 for styling and responsive design
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+) for DOM manipulation, event handling, and app logic

***

## Future Enhancements

Possible improvements and next steps:

- Add user accounts for real login/signup experience
- Store applications persistently via backend or browser storage
- Add job posting interface for employers
- Implement pagination or load more for large listings
- Add advanced filters such as salary range, job type, or experience level
- Support resume upload and application tracking
- Improve accessibility based on ARIA roles and keyboard navigation enhancements
